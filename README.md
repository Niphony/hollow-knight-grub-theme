## Installation
Install the files:
```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/sergoncano/hollow-knight-grub-theme.git

# Go into the repository
$ cd hollow-knight-grub-theme

# Run the installer
$ sudo ./install_theme.sh
```
Now set the theme in your grub config (```/etc/default/grub```) by adding (or modifying) the following line:
```bash
GRUB_THEME="/boot/grub/themes/hollow-grub/theme.txt"
#And just for verifiaction see if this line got the max res of your monitor 1080 is the usual:
GRUB_GFXMODE=1920x1080x32
```
Finally reload the GRUB config:
```bash
sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```
<br>

Alternatively, if using **Arch Linux** you can get it from the AUR:
```bash
yay -S grub-theme-hollow-knight #the yay repo only contains hollow knight backgrounds not silksong
```
## Customization
If you want to add a new background, just put it in the ```wallpapers/``` directory. After that, run the install script again and choose it when prompted for.
For now it has all the background image in both silksong and hollow knight (Finally silksong is out :D)
